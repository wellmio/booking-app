## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to see available massage chair time slots on a calendar, select a time, and pay for my booking seamlessly using Stripe, so that I can easily book a massage chair experience.

As an admin, I want to view all bookings and manage available time slots from a dashboard, so that I can effectively manage the service.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**User Booking**

1.  **Given** I am on the booking page, **When** I select a date on the calendar, **Then** I should see the available time slots for that day.
2.  **Given** I have selected an available time slot, **When** I proceed to book, **Then** I am presented with a Stripe payment form.
3.  **Given** I have successfully completed the payment via Stripe, **When** I am redirected back to the app, **Then** I see a confirmation of my booking.

**Admin Management** 4. **Given** I am logged in as an admin, **When** I navigate to the admin dashboard, **Then** I can view a list of all bookings. 5. **Given** I am on the admin dashboard, **When** I navigate to the timeslot management section, **Then** I can create, update, and delete available time slots.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to book a time slot that becomes unavailable while they are in the process of paying?
- How does the system handle failed payments from Stripe?
- What happens if an admin tries to delete a timeslot that is already booked?

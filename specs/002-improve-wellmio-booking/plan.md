# Implementation Plan: Improve Wellmio Booking Experience

**Branch**: `002-improve-wellmio-booking` | **Date**: 2025-09-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/002-improve-wellmio-booking/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

This feature will enhance the user's booking experience by adding a calendar to view availability, integrating Stripe for payments, and providing administrators with tools to manage bookings and timeslots. The technical approach will use `shadcn/ui` for the calendar component and Stripe Checkout for the payment flow.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript ^5, Next.js 15.5.2
**Primary Dependencies**: `next`, `react`, `stripe`, `@supabase/supabase-js`, `tailwindcss`, `shadcn/ui`
**Storage**: Supabase (PostgreSQL)
**Testing**: Jest
**Target Platform**: Web
**Project Type**: Web application
**Performance Goals**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., p95 latency for booking API < 200ms]
**Constraints**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., must support mobile web browsers]
**Scale/Scope**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: e.g., expected number of daily bookings]

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**Simplicity**:

- Projects: 1 (web app)
- Using framework directly? Yes
- Single data model? Yes
- Avoiding patterns? Yes

**Architecture**:

- EVERY feature as library? No, this is a feature within an existing application.
- Libraries listed: N/A
- CLI per library: N/A
- Library docs: N/A

**Testing (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**:

- RED-GREEN-Refactor cycle enforced? Yes
- Git commits show tests before implementation? Yes
- Order: Contract→Integration→E2E→Unit strictly followed? Yes
- Real dependencies used? Yes
- Integration tests for: new libraries, contract changes, shared schemas? Yes
- FORBIDDEN: Implementation before test, skipping RED phase. Yes

**Observability**:

- Structured logging included? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Frontend logs → backend? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
- Error context sufficient? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

**Versioning**:

- Version number assigned? Yes (0.1.0)
- BUILD increments on every change? No
- Breaking changes handled? N/A

**Structure Decision**: Option 2: Web application

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

Completed. See `research.md`.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

Completed. See `data-model.md`, `contracts/openapi.yaml`, and `quickstart.md`.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| N/A                        |                    |                                      |

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a user, I want to book a massage chair appointment through a web app, pay for it, and receive an email confirmation. As an admin, I want to be able to change booking options.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user is on the booking page, **When** they select an available time slot and complete the payment process, **Then** they should receive a booking confirmation email.
2. **Given** an admin is logged into the admin panel, **When** they navigate to the booking options, **Then** they should be able to modify settings like price, duration, and availability.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user tries to book a time slot that just became unavailable?
- How does the system handle payment failures?
- What happens if the email confirmation fails to send?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to view available massage chair appointment slots.
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to select a time slot and book an appointment.
- **FR-003**: System MUST process payments for bookings. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What payment gateway should be used? e.g., Stripe, PayPal]
- **FR-004**: System MUST send a confirmation email to the user after a successful booking.
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide an admin interface to manage booking options.
- **FR-006**: Admins MUST be able to log in to the admin interface. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What authentication method should be used for admins?]
- **FR-007**: Admins MUST be able to change booking options such as price, duration, and availability of massage chairs. [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are all the configurable booking options?]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **User**: Represents a customer booking an appointment. Attributes: name, email.
- **Appointment**: Represents a single booking. Attributes: user, time slot, payment status.
- **Time Slot**: Represents an available booking time. Attributes: start time, end time, status (available/booked).
- **Admin**: Represents a user with administrative privileges.
- **Booking Option**: Represents a configurable setting for appointments. Attributes: name, value (e.g., price, duration).
